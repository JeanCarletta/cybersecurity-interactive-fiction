## To successfully update website

### On Windows
Run build.bat and rebuild.bat - this creates .twee and .html files for the build.yml file to work with and deploy to GitHub Pages. Alternatively, you can use the 'npm run build' and 'npm run rebuild' commands in the command line.

### On *nix OSes (MacOS, Linux, etc.)
Run `./build.sh` in your terminal/shell, which has the same effect as running the `.bat` files mentioned in the previous section.
